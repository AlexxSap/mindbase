#+title: Zen Of Go

- Each package fulfils a single purpose
- Handle errors explicitly
- Return early rather than nesting deeply
- Leave concurrency to the caller
- Before you launch a goroutine, know when it will stop
- Avoid package level state
- Simplicity matters
- Write tests to lock in the behaviour of your package’s API
- If you think it’s slow, first prove it with a benchmark
- Moderation is a virtue
- Maintainability counts
