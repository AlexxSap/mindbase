The following are some of the most commonly used options for the `go build` command:

- `-o`: Specifies the output file name. The default output file name is the name of the main package, with the `.exe` suffix added on Windows.
- `-v`: Verbose output. This option prints the names of the packages as they are being compiled.
- `-work`: Prints the name of the temporary work directory and does not delete it when exiting. This option is useful for debugging.
- `-x`: Print the commands. This option prints the commands that are being executed by the `go build` command.
- `-asmflags`: Arguments to pass to the `go tool asm` invocation.
- `-buildmode`: The build mode to use. The default build mode is `exe`. Other possible values are `shared`, `pie`, and `plugin`.
- `-buildvcs`: Whether to stamp binaries with version control information. The default value is `auto`.
